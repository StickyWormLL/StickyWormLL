Hello! 👋 I'm @StickyWormLL a passionate indie game developer with experience in Unity and Godot Engine. I started my journey in the world of game development in 2020 using Unity, and in early 2024 I switched to Godot Engine, where I have found a new source of inspiration and creativity. 🎮✨

Throughout my career, I have worked on numerous projects, learning and improving with each one. Although many of these projects never saw the light of day, each experience has been an important step in my professional development. Currently, I'm working on an exciting project that might be released on Steam… we'll see! 🚀

I'm the founder of Xorunix, an indie game studio. On our YouTube channel, I share tutorials about Godot Engine to help other developers learn and grow in this amazing community. 📚🕹️
